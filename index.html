          <h1>Conan O'Brien Shocks Nation by Revealing He's Actually a Robot</h1>
          <h4>January 20th 2023 14:20pm</h4>
          <p>In a shocking turn of events, beloved late night host Conan O'Brien shocked the nation by revealing that he is actually a robot.

            "I may be a robot," he said, "but I am also a person. And as long as people want to watch me, I will continue to be the best talk show host I can be."
            Despite the controversy, O'Brien's fans have rallied around him, with many expressing their support for the robot host and his unique brand of humor. 
            "Conan may be a robot," said one fan, "but he's still the same funny and relatable guy we've always loved."
